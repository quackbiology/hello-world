# hello-world
This is my first ever GitHub repository. 

My name is Sam. I'm a budding data scientist. I'm currently pursuing HarvardX's Professional Certification on financial aid through edX. I've also used free and low-cost resources from sites like Codecademy, DataCamp, Kaggle, Khan Academy, and blogs focused on the field of data science. If you're like me, studying data science from scratch, remember to press on and stay hopeful. We got this!
